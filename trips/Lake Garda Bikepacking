## Arrival in Arco

Our first mission of the trip started at an early start of 1:30pm where we finally made the decision to start hiking up towards the Matterhorn looking peak of Cathedral peak which we had no idea what it looked like, good start. After 1hr and half we saw the sharp peak in front of us along with a party asking if we knew the descent beta. We obviously didn’t, after an explanation we still had no idea. Finally racking up after such a long process not just hiking but driving 2 days never felt better. This was a zoo, it was the closest thing to a climbing gym without people checking if people know how to belay properly. Ropes running on top of each other, people learning how to build an anchor at the base, backpacks being hauled, backpacks not haul bags, backpacks. It was a great introduction to the valley, 6 pitches of pure fun and adventure where everything converges at the summit. We got to final pitch as the sun was just about down, the sunset illuminated the valley, it was a painting of pink and yellow. The final pitch leads up to a final totem block where we sit and debate how to get down. Scared, cold and it’s pitch black as the wind is now hitting us on this exposed summit, it was 5.6, 6 pitches, a humbling start. A party of unknowing climbers rap off a fridge size detached block, risky, is this our best option. A light beam from a group of 2 swing around the block as we talk politics with the others. “This is the way down, that looks fucking sketch”. They had just completed the Tuolumne Triple, the 3 prominent summits in the meadows in a day. They showed us way down as we scrambled down to the trail. No way we we’re finding this by ourselves even in broad daylight. This was the experience I needed we all needed, we just hoped the other group got down safely and didn’t have the pleasure of being “BeKnighted” and off to the Valley to see what else this place had to offer. én in 2022 knowing that I would not be back the following year. I wanted to take a break from the place
