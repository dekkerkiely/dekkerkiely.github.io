    <p>Hi! I’m Dekker Kiely — an engineer and outdoor adventurer based in Canada. I spend most of my time climbing, skiing, cycling and working on creative mechanical projects. I created this website to share an insight into my adventures and ensures.</p>

    <p>I am from Fredericton, New Brunswick that is where I spent most of my childhood. I was introduced to skiing and hockey at a very young age, where I pursued my passion for hockey until the age of 20. This sport gave me many opportunities to where I had the privilege of going to a private school and also played at a junior level.</p>

    <p>After quitting hockey due to the desire to pursue an engineering degree full-time, I was reintroduced to my love for skiing and the outdoors. That’s where I discovered climbing, starting with bouldering and eventually connecting with a community who showed me the ropes. From there, my passion for the outdoors grew.</p>

    <p>Since then, I’ve traveled across East Africa, Asia, and Europe seeking new experiences. Now, I’m a mechanical engineering graduate with a desire to combine adventure and engineering in everything I do.</p>
