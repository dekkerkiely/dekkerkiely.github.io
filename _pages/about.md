Hi! I'm Dekker Kiely â€” an engineer and outdoor adventurer based in Canada. I spend most of my time climbing, skiing, cycling and working on creative mechanical projects. I created this website to share an insight into my adventures and ensures. 

I am from Fredericton, New Brunsick that is where i sent most of my childhood. I was introducted to skiing and hockey at a very young age, where i pursuit my passion for hockey until the age of 20. This sport gave me many oppertunitities to where i had the priviledge of going to a private school and also played at a junior level. After quitting hockey due to the desire to pursuing an engineering degree full time, i was reintroducted to my love for skiing and the outdoors. This is where i was intoducted to the sport of climbing. I'm not certain but it had to been Free solo that just made me buy a pair of climbing shoes to where i started outdoor bouldering. This grew into finding out there was climbing gyms where i meet a great group of people willing to show me the ropes. From this my love for mountains and climbing grew where i had a desrire to be adventuring as much as i could, that was until i failed a lot of classes and had to dial back. Through my time getting my mechanical engineering degree I've traveled across East Africa, Asia, and Europe, always seeking new expirences which leads me to where i am now. A fresh graduate with a desire to put myself in new expirences wether that's climbing or design related.
